    <h1>Project 1 - Images of the Russian Empire</h1>

    <h1>Ethan Chen</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      This project aims to programatically apply image processing techniques on
      photos from the Prokudin-Gorskii collection, primarily with a naive
      approach then a pyramid approach, to produce an image with color.
    </p>

    <h2>Naive Approach</h2>

    <p>First, we consider two optimization objectives:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC)</b>: the dot product of two
        normalized vectors
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Sum of Squared Differences (SSD)</b>: we use what's state in the name
        to calculate this metric
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      In the python notebook <code>main.ipynb</code>, we can see that the
      displacement pairs for both aligning red and green channels with the blue
      one are the same across all 3 JPGs. As expected and as a result, we don't
      see any difference between the qualities of the three image pairs. We will
      proceed with SSD as the metric since it requires fewer computations per
      pair of images than NCC requires (also so we can follow Occam's razor).
    </p>

    <h3>Implementation</h3>

    <p>
      We can approach the 3 JPGs naively because they are small images so the
      search space isn't too large for this brute force method and the algorithm
      won't take long.
      <br />
      <br />
      First, we extract an image for each of the red, green, blue channels from
      the JPG. Then, we crop each with a 10% margin to avoid the edge artifacts
      from impacting the brute force search. The borders don't contain useful
      information and we don't want some pixels in our search box of all
      possible shifts to find a best metric score, and thus alignment, with a
      pixel in the edge.
      <br />
      <br />
      Then, we search over the mentioned above box (with the same
      <code>max_shift</code> for the x- and y-axis), compute the score on that
      current shifted image and ultimately, choose the best shift (x, y) with
      the best metric score. After, we use <code>np.roll()</code> on this best
      shift to efficiently perform the shift to translate the original image,
      <bold>not the cropped image</bold>. Finally, we stack the pre-cropped and
      shifted images to get our final colored image.

      <br />
      <br />
      Let's denote the search strategy of naive align on two images as
      <code>naive_align</code>.

    <h2>Pyramid Approach</h2>

    <h3>Motivation</h3>

    <h4>Implementation</h4>

    <p>
      Initially, just like in naive align, we extract the red, green, and blue
      images from the image file and crop <b>10%</b> from each side. This
      pre-processing is applied to both calls to align pairs of (green, blue)
      and (red, blue) in this pyramid approach.
      <br />
      Next, I find how much we can downscale, each time by a factor of 2, which
      was recommended by one of the TAs during a project party. I found that a
      restricting our maximum downscale to a minimum size of
      <code>100</code> (of both width and height dimensions) worked best.
      <br />
      <br />

      Then, I directly downscaled, without a loop, my pair of images by
      <code>1/2 ^ {number of layers}</code> and applied naive align (same method
      as the one used in my Naive Approach) with a search size of 15 on the
      pair. Now, we need to upscale back to the original dimensions, which I do
      with the same factor of 2. At each layer, I resize the images, double both
      dimensions of my best shift so far, and then call naive align with a
      search size (<code>max_shift</code>) of 20 to readjust the best shift.
      <br />

      <b>Note</b>: The algorithm above produced <b>all</b> the images with
      displacements shown below, <b>except</b> for <code>emir.tif</code>, which
      I had to change the minimum size of downscaling to <code>200</code>. When
      I displayed all raw tifs, I noticed that the contrast between the three
      red, green, and blue channels was much significant than it was for all
      other images. This is due to the images not having the same brightness
      values. Other tifs had much more similarity amongst their three red,
      green, and blue channels.
    </p>

    <h2>Bells and Whistles</h2>

    I tried several strategies to improve the quality of some images:

    <ol>
      <li>Adaptive Histogram</li>
    </ol>
